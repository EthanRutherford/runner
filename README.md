# .runner

## Description:
A console based c++ project manager. Covers creating/deleting projects and source/header files, compiling and linking, etc. with a nice, rendered menu.

## Current Status:
The state of the project is in somewhat disarray, it has been a solo project for a while, and is lacking in proper commenting, and as I'm fairly new to programming, there are probably many things that could be done better.
